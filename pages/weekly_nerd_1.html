        <h1>Weekly Nerd - Stephen Hay</h1>
        <blockquote>
          Native Californian Stephen Hay has been living and working in Leeuwarden, the Netherlands since 1992, and designing for the web since 1995. His roots as a designer and art director in corporate identity / packaging design and advertising served as a foundation for his current work as web design and development strategist through his own user experience consultancy Zero Interface.
        </blockquote>
        <p> Stephen's Talk was about the good and evil of CSS. The languages are slowly changing and the challenge for most designers is to get the basics of HTML & CSS. Both of the language will get you far. Frameworks change faster than you.</p>
